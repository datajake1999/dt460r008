 *  --- -----   ----------- 	---------------------------------------
 *  004 MGS     05/15/1996 		moved PKSD_T typedef to kernel.h
 *	005 MGS		05/31/1996 		started merging spanish
 *	006	EDB		01/10/1997		add "delay_cnt" and move "modulcount" 
 *	007 EAB		04/9/97			for BATS#346
 *                              Added new variable had_hatbegin and had_hatend,
 *  008	GL		04/21/1997		BATS#357  Add the code for __osf__ build 
 *  009	GL		04/21/1997		BATS#360  remove spaces before "#define" or "#if" 
 *	010	MGS		08/26/1997		Merged in fasttalk
 * 	011 EAB		07/08/1997		Added new variable vot and tarbas
 *	012	MGS		10/14/1997		BATS #470 fixed crash due to reset
 * 	013 GL		10/22/1997		Change ULONG to "U32"
 *  014 CJL     11/10/1997      Add glide_tot & oddeven.
 *  015 GL      12/12/1997      Add ends_in_r for LINKRWORD support in UK_English
 *	016 EAB		1/10/98			Added length to f0_command for British Inotnation bats 575
	017 EAB		1/22/98			Added prevtarg0 prevnphon and done for Bats 575 british intonation
	018 EAB		3/10/98			Added new variable tot_enddrop
	019 EAB		3/27/98			Added new variable Word_has_stress
	020 EAB		4/27/98			Added several new varibles related intonation and prosody I expect to use
								them in all languages so I haven't ifdef'd them out becuase it would be a
								ifndef NWSNOAA which being a single point product it didn't seem worth
								adding another ifdef for so few variables
    0021 EAB 7/13/98 BATS 711		Added number_vowels and increase feature bits array
	0022 EAb 1/25/99 Improved UK linkr in phsort code so that ends_in_r no_longer needed
